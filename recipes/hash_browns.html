    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My Grandma made these simple hash browns nearly every morning when I spent time with her. They take a little planning, but they're better than any others! Serve with your favorite style eggs and breakfast meat!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 large russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large saucepan, cover potatoes with water. Bring water to a boil and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Let cool in refrigerator overnight.</li>
        <li>The next morning, heat butter in a large skillet or frying pan. Shred potatoes and add to pan. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until golden brown on bottom, flip and brown on other side.</li>
    </ol>
